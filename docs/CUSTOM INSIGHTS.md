That’s a **great** use case! Businesses, especially in retail, hospitality, and events, could use **BlueTracker** to analyze foot traffic trends and customer behavior over time.

### **Use Case: Customer Insights for Businesses**
#### 🔍 **Understanding New vs. Repeat Customers**
By tracking Bluetooth signals, businesses can estimate how many unique visitors they get and how often people return.  

✅ **New Customers** → Devices seen for the first time.  
✅ **Repeat Customers** → Devices detected on multiple visits.  

---

### **How It Works**
1. **Scan for Bluetooth devices** in a store or venue.  
2. **Log device identifiers** (MAC addresses or hashed versions for privacy).  
3. **Store timestamps** and GPS location for each detection.  
4. **Analyze visit frequency** to differentiate new vs. returning customers.

### **Why It’s Useful**
📊 **Measure Customer Loyalty** – Identify repeat customers and retention trends.  
📈 **Optimize Store Layout** – Adjust promotions based on visitor flow.  
💰 **Improve Marketing Campaigns** – Target new vs. returning customers differently.  
🛍 **Compare Locations** – Understand traffic variations between multiple stores.

### **Example Insights**
- **Daily & Weekly Foot Traffic Trends**
- **% of Visitors Returning Within 30 Days**
- **Time Spent in Store Per Visit**
- **Peak Hours for New vs. Repeat Customers**

### **Privacy Considerations**
Since Bluetooth tracking involves device identifiers, businesses should:  
✔ **Anonymize Data** (e.g., hashing MAC addresses).  
✔ **Allow Opt-Out** (e.g., signs informing customers of tracking).  
✔ **Use Data Responsibly** (only for aggregate insights, not personal tracking).
