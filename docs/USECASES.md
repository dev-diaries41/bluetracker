Yes! To enable **global tracking**, we should include **GPS coordinates** with each scan. This way, we can:  

✅ Track **where** devices were detected.  
✅ Identify **movement patterns** of frequent devices.  
✅ Implement **geo-fencing** for businesses or security use cases.  

---

## **Key Enhancements**
1. **Add GPS Coordinates** (`latitude, longitude`) to each `DeviceEntry`.  
2. **Fetch Current GPS Location** of the scanning device (host).  
3. **Modify `store_scan_data()`** to store GPS data.  
4. **Extend Search Functionality** to filter devices based on location.

## **New Features**
1. ✅ **GPS Location Tracking**
   - Each device entry stores **latitude** & **longitude** of the last scan.
   - Updates GPS coordinates every time a device is seen.

2. ✅ **Find Devices by Location**
   - Uses the **Haversine formula** to compute real-world distances between GPS points.
   - Allows querying for devices **within X km of a location**.

3. ✅ **Better Search Capabilities**
   - Find by **Name** or **Address**.
   - Find all devices **within a given radius**.

## **Example Use Cases**
🔵 **Retail Stores** → Track the number of new vs. returning customers.  
🔵 **Traffic Analytics** → Monitor Bluetooth signals from cars & phones to analyze congestion.  
🔵 **Security** → Identify unknown devices in **restricted areas**.  
🔵 **Lost & Found** → Track last seen **locations** of devices over time.

### 🚀 **Next Steps**
Would you like me to:
1. **Save data to a database** (PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)?
2. **Export data to a file** (JSON, CSV, etc.)?
3. **Create a visualization** (Map UI with tracking)?
